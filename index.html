	<p id="text">In your love , I am also floating like here and there, please collect me and keep me in your heart only. Words cannot express the depth of my love for you. Every moment I spend with you is a treasure beyond measure. Your smile brightens my day, and your touch fills me with a warmth that nothing else can match.

You are the light in my life, the beating of my heart, and the reason for my every breath. I am endlessly grateful for the love that you bring into my life, and I cherish every moment we spend together.

I promise to always be there for you, to support you through thick and thin, and to love you with every fiber of my being. You are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with, and I cannot imagine a future without you by my side.</p>
